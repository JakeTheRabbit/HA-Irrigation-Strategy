# Advanced AI Crop Steering System - Python Dependencies
# Required packages for mathematical models and sensor fusion
# Compatible with Home Assistant OS / AppDaemon containers

# Core Data Processing and Mathematical Models
numpy>=1.21.0          # Required for mathematical operations
pandas>=1.3.0          # Required for data handling
scipy>=1.7.0           # Required for statistical analysis and signal processing

# Visualization and Dashboard  
plotly>=5.0.0          # Required for real-time dashboard graphs

# HTTP Requests (for API integration)
requests>=2.25.0       # Required for external API calls

# Note: This system uses mathematical models instead of compiled ML libraries
# for compatibility with Home Assistant OS containers.
# 
# scikit-learn is NOT required - we use scipy-based mathematical models
# that don't require C++ compilation and work in restricted containers.
#
# Install in AppDaemon with: pip install numpy pandas scipy plotly requests
