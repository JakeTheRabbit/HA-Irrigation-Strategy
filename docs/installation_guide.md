# üöÄ Installation Guide - Beginner Friendly

This step-by-step guide will walk you through installing the Crop Steering System, even if you're new to Home Assistant. We'll cover everything you need to know!

## üìã What You'll Need Before Starting

### ‚úÖ Required Items
**Home Assistant Setup:**
- Home Assistant installed and running (any installation method works)
- Access to Home Assistant web interface
- Basic familiarity with Home Assistant (know how to navigate to Settings)

**Physical Hardware:**
- At least 1 moisture sensor (VWC) per growing area
- At least 1 nutrient sensor (EC) per growing area  
- Water pump that can be controlled by Home Assistant
- Solenoid valve for main water line
- Individual zone valves (up to 6 zones supported)

**New to Home Assistant?** Check out the [official documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) first!

## üéØ Installation Methods

**Choose Your Method:**

### Method 1: HACS Installation (Easiest - Recommended)
‚úÖ **Best for beginners**  
‚úÖ **Automatic updates**  
‚úÖ **One-click installation**

### Step 1: Install HACS (If Not Already Installed)
**Already have HACS?** Skip to Step 2!

**Don't have HACS yet?**
1. Follow the official HACS installation guide: https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download
2. This usually involves downloading a script and running it
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. HACS will appear in your sidebar

### Step 2: Add Our Repository to HACS
1. **Open HACS** from your Home Assistant sidebar
2. **Click "Integrations"** tab at the top
3. **Click the three dots (‚ãÆ)** in the top right
4. **Select "Custom repositories"**
5. **Fill out the form:**
   - Repository URL: `https://github.com/JakeTheRabbit/HA-Irrigation-Strategy`
   - Category: Select `Integration`
6. **Click "ADD"**

‚úÖ **Success Check:** You should see a confirmation that the repository was added

### Step 3: Download the Integration
1. **Stay in HACS ‚Üí Integrations**
2. **Search for "Crop Steering"** in the search box
3. **Click on "Crop Steering System"** when it appears
4. **Click "DOWNLOAD"** (blue button)
5. **Wait for download** (you'll see a progress indicator)
6. **When complete, restart Home Assistant:**
   - Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Restart (red "Restart" button)
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for restart to complete

‚úÖ **Success Check:** After restart, continue to Step 4

### Step 4: Add the Integration to Your System
1. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**
2. **Click the blue "+ ADD INTEGRATION" button** (bottom right)
3. **Search for "Crop Steering"** and select it
4. **Choose your setup method** (pick what matches your situation):

   **üåü Advanced Setup (Recommended for most users):**
   - Configure zones and sensors through easy forms
   - Best for complete systems with sensors
   
   **üîß Basic Setup:**
   - Just creates switches for manual control
   - Good for testing or simple setups
   
   **üìÅ Load from file:**
   - Only if you have an existing crop_steering.env file
   - For users upgrading from older versions

**Follow the setup wizard** - it will ask you step-by-step for:
- Number of zones (1-6)
- Your pump and valve entities
- Your sensor entities (if any)

‚úÖ **Success Check:** You should see "Crop Steering System" in your device list

### Step 5: Add Full Automation (Optional but Recommended)

**ü§î Do I need this step?**
- **Skip if:** You want manual control only

   - Destination: `/config/custom_components/crop_steering/`
   
2. The structure should look like:
   ```
   /config/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_components/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ crop_steering/
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config_flow.py
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sensor.py
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ switch.py
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ number.py
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ select.py
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other files)
   ```

3. Restart Home Assistant

### Step 3: Add the Integration
Same as HACS Step 4 above - use the GUI to configure

### Step 4: Install AppDaemon Apps (Optional)
Same as HACS Step 5 above

## üéõÔ∏è System Configuration

### üéØ Basic Configuration (Required)
The setup wizard will walk you through this:

**Zone Setup:**
- How many growing areas do you have? (1-6 zones)
- Each zone can have its own sensors and controls

**Hardware Mapping:**
- **Water Pump:** The entity that turns your pump on/off
- **Main Valve:** The solenoid that controls your main water line
- **Zone Valves:** Individual valves for each growing area

*Don't know your entity names?* Check Developer Tools ‚Üí States

### üå°Ô∏è Sensor Configuration (Optional)
For each zone, you can add:

**Moisture Monitoring:**
- **Front VWC Sensor:** Moisture sensor at front of growing area
- **Back VWC Sensor:** Second moisture sensor for better accuracy

**Nutrient Monitoring:**
- **Front EC Sensor:** Nutrient/salt level sensor at front
- **Back EC Sensor:** Second EC sensor for better accuracy

**Environmental Sensors (system-wide):**
- **Temperature Sensor:** Air temperature
- **Humidity Sensor:** Relative humidity
- **VPD Sensor:** Vapor Pressure Deficit (if available)

**üí° Pro Tip:** You can always add more sensors later by reconfiguring the integration

### Legacy Configuration (crop_steering.env)
If you have an existing setup, you can load from your crop_steering.env file by selecting "Load from file" during setup.

## ‚úÖ Test Your Installation

### üîç Quick System Check

**1. Check Integration Status**
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**
- Look for **"Crop Steering System"** device
- Should show green "Connected" status
- Click on it to see all your zones

**2. Verify Entities Were Created**
- Go to **Developer Tools ‚Üí States**
- Type **"crop_steering"** in the filter box
- You should see many entities like:
  - `sensor.crop_steering_current_phase`
  - `switch.crop_steering_system_enabled`
  - `switch.crop_steering_zone_1_enabled` (for each zone)
  - `number.crop_steering_p1_target_vwc`
  - And many more!

**3. Test Basic Control**
- Find `switch.crop_steering_system_enabled`
- Try turning it OFF and ON
- The state should change immediately

**4. Check AppDaemon (if installed)**
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí AppDaemon 4**
- Click the **"Log"** tab
- Look for: `Master Crop Steering Application initialized`
- **If you see errors:** Double-check your token and configuration

### üö® Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Problem: "I don't see Crop Steering in Add Integration"**
- ‚úÖ **Solution:** Restart Home Assistant and wait 2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Check:** Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs for any error messages

**Problem: "AppDaemon won't start or shows errors"**
- ‚úÖ **Check your token:** Go to your Profile ‚Üí Long-Lived Access Tokens
- ‚úÖ **Verify URL:** Should be `http://192.168.1.XXX:8123` (use your HA IP)
- ‚úÖ **Check timezone:** Must match your Home Assistant timezone
- ‚úÖ **Remember:** The integration works fine without AppDaemon for manual control

**Problem: "I only see some of my zones"**
- ‚úÖ **This is normal:** Entities are only created for the zones you configured
- ‚úÖ **Want more zones?** Reconfigure the integration to add them

**Problem: "My sensors show 'Unknown' or 'None'"**
- ‚úÖ **Check entity names:** Go to Developer Tools ‚Üí States and verify your sensor entity names
- ‚úÖ **Check sensor status:** Make sure your physical sensors are working

## üéâ You're Done! What's Next?

### üå± First-Time Setup
1. **Choose your crop profile:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Crop Steering System ‚Üí Configure
   - Select your plant type (Cannabis, Tomato, Lettuce, etc.)
   - Choose growth stage (Vegetative or Generative)

2. **Set your light schedule:**
   - Look for `number.crop_steering_lights_on_hour` entity
   - Set when your lights turn on (0-23 hours)
   - Set when lights turn off with `number.crop_steering_lights_off_hour`

3. **Test manual control:**
   - Try the service `crop_steering.execute_irrigation_shot`
   - Set zone=1, duration_seconds=30 for a quick test

### ü§ñ If You Installed AppDaemon
**Your system will now:**
- Automatically transition through phases each day (P0‚ÜíP1‚ÜíP2‚ÜíP3)
- Make smart irrigation decisions based on your sensors
- Provide professional monitoring dashboards
- Run completely autonomously

**Just watch it work!** üìä
