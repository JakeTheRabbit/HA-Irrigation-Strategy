### **🏗️ System Architecture Improvements**
- **✅ Proper Irrigation Sequencing**: Your specific switch sequence now properly implemented:
  1. Main pump power (`switch.f1_irrigation_pump_master_switch`)
  2. Main line valve (`switch.espoe_irrigation_relay_1_2`) 
  3. Zone valves with proper delays and shutdown sequence
- **✅ Missing Dependencies**: Added all missing input helper entities
- **✅ Blueprint Redundancy**: Eliminated confusing duplicate sensor configuration
- **✅ Modern Template Format**: Full compatibility with Home Assistant 2024.3+

## 📋 **MIGRATION GUIDE**

### **From v1.x to v2.0**

1. **Backup your current configuration** (important!)

2. **Install the new system**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Configure your entities**:
   ```bash
   cp crop_steering.env my_setup.env
   # Edit my_setup.env with your entity IDs
   python configure_crop_steering.py my_setup.env
   ```

4. **Update your dashboard**:
   - Remove old dashboard cards
   - Add new unified dashboard card

5. **Restart Home Assistant**

### **Configuration Changes**
