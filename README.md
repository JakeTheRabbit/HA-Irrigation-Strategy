## üîç How Crop Steering Works

**Crop steering** is a precision irrigation technique that controls plant growth by managing water stress through automated VWC (moisture) and EC (nutrient concentration) monitoring.

### The 4-Phase Daily Cycle

```
üåÖ P0 (Dryback) ‚Üí üå± P1 (Ramp-Up) ‚Üí üíß P2 (Maintenance) ‚Üí üåô P3 (Pre-Lights-Off)
```

**P0 - Morning Dryback**: Allow substrate to dry 15-20% from peak to stimulate root growth  
**P1 - Ramp-Up**: Progressive irrigation shots (2%‚Üí10% volume) to reach target VWC  
**P2 - Maintenance**: Threshold-based irrigation maintains optimal moisture all day  
**P3 - Pre-Lights-Off**: Reduced irrigation 90 minutes before lights out  

### What You Provide
- **Sensors**: VWC and EC sensors for each growing zone
- **Hardware**: Water pump, main valve, zone valves (up to 6 zones)
- **Configuration**: Pot sizes, flow rates, growth targets via easy setup wizard

### What You Get
- **Automated irrigation** synchronized with your light cycle
- **Real-time monitoring** with professional dashboards
- **Smart hardware control** with safety interlocks and error recovery
- **Historical analytics** for continuous optimization

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Two-Layer Design for Maximum Flexibility

**üè† Home Assistant Integration** (Always Required)
- Creates 100+ entities for complete system monitoring and control
- Handles all calculations: shot durations, EC ratios, threshold adjustments
- Provides manual controls and safety overrides
- Works standalone for manual operation or with basic automations

**ü§ñ AppDaemon Automation** (Recommended)
- Autonomous 4-phase cycle management
- Advanced sensor validation and statistical analysis
- Professional hardware sequencing with safety interlocks
- Optional LLM integration for intelligent decision assistance

**üîß Optional Enhancements**
- **LLM Integration**: GPT-5 powered decision assistance
- **Smart Learning**: Adaptive parameter optimization
- **Advanced Analytics**: Historical trend analysis and reporting

### Quick Setup Overview
1. **Install integration** via HACS (5 minutes)
2. **Configure zones** through Home Assistant UI (10 minutes) 
3. **Add automation** with AppDaemon for full autonomy (optional)
4. **Enable AI features** for intelligent optimization (optional)

> **Learn More**: See our [complete installation guide](docs/installation/complete-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## ü§ñ AI Integration (Optional)

**Add GPT-5 intelligence to your irrigation system** for advanced decision making while maintaining 100% safety through rule-based validation.

### How AI Enhancement Works
- **Stateless consultation**: AI analyzes current sensor snapshot and recommends actions
- **Rule-based validation**: Traditional logic validates all AI suggestions before execution  
- **Cost-effective**: Starting at $0.10-0.50/day with GPT-5-nano
- **Budget-controlled**: Automatic daily limits and emergency fallbacks

### Real Cost Examples
- **Basic Setup**: 480 decisions/day = $0.36/day with 90% caching
- **Advanced Setup**: Complex analysis + weekly reports = $1-3/day
- **Emergency Only**: AI for critical situations only = <$0.10/day

**Ready to add AI?** Follow our [LLM Integration Guide](docs/advanced-features/llm-integration.md) for setup and cost optimization.

> **Important**: The core system operates perfectly without AI. LLM integration is purely an enhancement for users wanting cutting-edge intelligence.
