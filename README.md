## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Pressure-Compensating Dripper Setup
```yaml
# Your existing hardware is perfect for intelligent learning!
dripper_specs:
  flow_rate: 1.2  # L/hr per dripper (pressure compensating)
  drippers_per_plant: 2
  plants_per_zone: 4
  
# System calculates exact water delivery:
# 30 seconds = (1.2 √ó 8 √ó 30) √∑ 3600 = 0.08L precisely
```

### Smart Learning Configuration
```yaml
# AppDaemon apps.yaml
