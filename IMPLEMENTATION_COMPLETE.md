# Implementation Complete: Advanced Zone Features

## Summary of Changes

All requested features have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ Zone Grouping for Simultaneous Irrigation
- Zones can be grouped (A-D) for synchronized irrigation
- When 50% of a group needs water, all zones in group irrigate
- Prevents uneven growth in grouped zones

### ✅ Zone-Specific Crop Profiles  
- Each zone can use a different crop profile
- Supports mixed crops/strains in same system
- Profiles include strain-specific VWC/EC targets

### ✅ Individual Zone Scheduling
- Each zone has independent light schedules
- Supports 12/12, 18/6, 20/4, 24/0, or custom
- Phase transitions based on zone's schedule

### ✅ Zone Priority Configuration
- Priority levels: Critical, High, Normal, Low
- Higher priority zones irrigate first
- Critical zones can interrupt lower priority

### ✅ Water Usage Tracking Per Zone
- Daily/weekly water usage monitoring
- Irrigation count tracking
- Configurable daily limits per zone
- Automatic usage resets

## How to Deploy

1. **Copy Updated Files:**
   ```bash
   # Copy integration files
   cp custom_components/crop_steering/*.py /config/custom_components/crop_steering/
   
   # Copy AppDaemon app
   cp appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/master_crop_steering_app.py /addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/
   ```

2. **Restart Services:**
   - Restart Home Assistant
   - Restart AppDaemon add-on

3. **Configure Zones:**
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Crop Steering
   - Configure each zone's group, priority, profile, and schedule
   - Set water limits and shot multipliers as needed

## New Entities Created

Per zone (1-6):
- `select.crop_steering_zone_X_group`
- `select.crop_steering_zone_X_priority`
- `select.crop_steering_zone_X_crop_profile`
- `select.crop_steering_zone_X_schedule`
- `number.crop_steering_zone_X_lights_on_hour`
- `number.crop_steering_zone_X_lights_off_hour`
- `number.crop_steering_zone_X_max_daily_volume`
- `number.crop_steering_zone_X_shot_size_multiplier`
- `sensor.crop_steering_zone_X_daily_water_usage`
- `sensor.crop_steering_zone_X_weekly_water_usage`
- `sensor.crop_steering_zone_X_irrigation_count_today`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Zone Grouping:**
   - Put 2 zones in same group
   - Lower VWC in one zone
   - Verify both zones irrigate together

2. **Test Priority:**
   - Set different priorities
   - Trigger multiple zones needing water
   - Verify priority order is respected

3. **Test Water Tracking:**
   - Run several irrigations
   - Check daily totals match expected volumes
   - Verify daily reset at midnight

4. **Test Individual Schedules:**
   - Set different light schedules
   - Verify each zone enters P0 at its lights-off time
   - Check P3 timing is zone-specific

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- Historical water usage database
- Water efficiency metrics
- Group performance comparison
- Schedule templates
- Water usage predictions
- Cost tracking per zone
