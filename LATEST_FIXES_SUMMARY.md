# Latest Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Per-Zone Phase Tracking Implementation ✅
- Each zone now operates independently through P0→P1→P2→P3 cycles
- Zones can be in different phases simultaneously
- Per-zone irrigation decisions based on individual zone conditions

### 2. P3 Logic Corrected ✅
- P3 is now the final dryback period AFTER the last P2 irrigation
- P3 only irrigates in true emergencies (VWC < 35%)
- ML-based timing to start P3 based on predicted dryback rates

### 3. Sensor "Unknown" States Fixed ✅
- Added `_create_initial_sensors` method to create sensors at startup
- `sensor.crop_steering_app_current_phase` now shows zone phase summary
- `sensor.crop_steering_app_next_irrigation` now shows calculated next irrigation time
- Individual zone phase sensors created: `sensor.crop_steering_zone_X_phase`

### 4. Zone-Specific Tracking ✅
- Last irrigation time tracked per zone in `zone_phase_data`
- Used for P3 transition logic to determine final P2 shot

## Code Changes

### master_crop_steering_app.py
1. Added per-zone phase tracking dictionaries
2. Added `_create_initial_sensors` method for startup sensor creation
3. Added `_get_phase_icon` method for phase icons
4. Updated `_execute_irrigation_shot` to track per-zone last irrigation time
5. Implemented `_should_zone_start_p3` for ML-based P3 timing
6. Updated `_check_phase_transitions` for per-zone transitions

### Key Features Now Working
- **Zone Independence**: Each zone transitions through phases independently
- **Smart P3 Timing**: ML predicts when to start final dryback per zone
- **Emergency Only P3**: P3 phase only irrigates at critical VWC levels
- **Sensor Integration**: All sensors properly created for HA integration
- **Last Irrigation Tracking**: Each zone tracks its last irrigation time

## How to Update

1. Copy the updated file:
   ```bash
   appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/master_crop_steering_app.py
   ```

2. Restart AppDaemon:
   - Go to Settings → Add-ons → AppDaemon 4
   - Click "Restart"

3. Wait 30 seconds for sensors to initialize

4. Check sensor states:
   - `sensor.crop_steering_current_phase` - Should show zone summary (e.g., "Z1:P2, Z2:P1, Z3:P2, Z4:P0")
   - `sensor.crop_steering_next_irrigation_time` - Should show timestamp or be calculating
   - `sensor.crop_steering_zone_X_phase` - Individual zone phases

## Next Steps
- Dashboard updates to display per-zone phase status (pending)
- Monitor zone transitions in logs
- Verify ML dryback predictions are working per zone
