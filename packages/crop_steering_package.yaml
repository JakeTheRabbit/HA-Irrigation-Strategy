# Home Assistant Crop Steering Package - Main Entry Point
# Advanced Irrigation Management System for Home Assistant
# ================================================================
#
# This is the main package file that loads all crop steering components
# from the organized CropSteering subdirectory structure.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Home Assistant 2024.3 or later (for modern template format)
# - AppDaemon 4.2+ for automation logic (crop_steering_app.py)
# - VWC (Volumetric Water Content) sensors
# - EC (Electrical Conductivity) sensors
# - Irrigation control valves/pumps
#
# FEATURES:
# - 4-phase crop steering cycle (P0-P3)
# - Multi-crop profile support (Cannabis, Tomato, Lettuce, Basil, Custom)
# - Advanced sensor fusion with outlier detection
# - ML-based dryback prediction and pattern recognition
# - Comprehensive analytics and performance monitoring
# - MQTT remote monitoring and control
# - Anomaly detection and alerting
# - Growth stage prediction and recommendations
#

# ================================================================
# AUTOMATION NOTES:
# ================================================================
# Primary automation logic is handled by AppDaemon (crop_steering_app.py)
# 
# MQTT automations are in CropSteering/cs_mqtt_automations.yaml but must be included
# separately in configuration.yaml to avoid circular references:
#
# Add this to your configuration.yaml:
# automation mqtt_crop_steering: !include packages/CropSteering/cs_mqtt_automations.yaml
# 
# If not using AppDaemon, you would need to create additional automation
# files to replace the AppDaemon logic for:
# - Phase transitions (P0->P1->P2->P3)
# - Irrigation triggering based on VWC thresholds
# - Dryback monitoring and calculations
# - Shot counting and timing
