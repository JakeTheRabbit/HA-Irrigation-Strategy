# Home Assistant Crop Steering Package
# Loads all necessary configurations for the improved crop steering system.

# Include all input helpers (selects, numbers, datetimes)
input_select: !include crop_steering_variables.yaml
input_number: !include crop_steering_variables.yaml
input_datetime: !include crop_steering_variables.yaml

# Include template sensors (calculations, status, etc.)
# Includes sensors defined using the modern 'template:' structure
template:
  - !include crop_steering_improved_sensors.yaml
  - !include crop_steering_aggregation_sensors.yaml

# Automations are handled by the AppDaemon script (crop_steering_app.py)
# or need to be created manually based on the helpers defined in variables.yaml
# automation: !include crop_steering_improved_automations.yaml # Removed to avoid errors if file is missing and AppDaemon is used

# Note: This package assumes the following files exist in the same directory:
# - crop_steering_variables.yaml (containing input_select, input_number, input_datetime, input_text, input_boolean)
# - crop_steering_improved_sensors.yaml (containing template sensors)
# - crop_steering_aggregation_sensors.yaml (containing template sensors)
# - crop_steering_dryback_tracking.yaml (containing template sensors for dryback)
# - crop_steering_zone_controls.yaml (containing template sensors/switches for zones)

# You might need to adjust sensor includes if they are not directly under the 'sensor:' key
# For example, if aggregation sensors were under their own key, you'd need:
# sensor: !include crop_steering_improved_sensors.yaml # Example if files didn't use modern template structure
# sensor_aggregation: !include crop_steering_aggregation_sensors.yaml

# Using modern template structure requires includes under the 'template:' key as list items.
